# DeepSight AI - MRI Machine Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to configure your MRI machine to send images directly to DeepSight AI for real-time analysis, annotation, and reporting.

## Prerequisites
- MRI machine with DICOM capabilities
- Network connectivity between MRI and DeepSight AI server
- Administrative access to MRI scanner configuration
- DeepSight AI server running and accessible

## Step 1: Get Your API Token

### 1.1 Access DeepSight Imaging AI Dashboard
1. Launch DeepSight Imaging AI application
2. Navigate to "‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud DICOM API" in the sidebar
3. Go to "üë• Customer Management" tab
4. Create a new customer account or select existing customer
5. Go to "üîë API Configuration" tab

### 1.2 Generate API Token
1. Copy your unique API token from the dashboard
2. Note the API endpoints:
   - **Base URL**: `https://api.deepsightimaging.ai`
   - **Upload Endpoint**: `/api/v1/upload`
   - **Status Endpoint**: `/api/v1/status`
3. Test your token using the provided cURL example

### 1.3 Verify API Access
- API token should be active and valid
- Test connection using the "Test Connection" button
- Ensure your network can reach `https://api.deepsightimaging.ai`

## Step 2: MRI Machine Configuration

### 2.1 Access MRI Scanner Settings
1. Log into MRI scanner with administrative privileges
2. Navigate to **Network** or **DICOM** settings
3. Look for **DICOM Configuration** or **Network Services**

### 2.2 Configure API Upload
1. Find **DICOM Export** or **Network Services**
2. Configure API-based upload settings
3. Set the following parameters:

#### For All MRI Manufacturers (Cloud API):
```
API Base URL: https://api.deepsightimaging.ai
API Endpoint: /api/v1/upload
Authentication: Bearer Token
API Token: [Your unique API token]
Content Type: application/dicom
Max File Size: 500MB
Timeout: 300 seconds
```

#### Example Configuration:
```bash
# Environment Variables
export API_BASE_URL="https://api.deepsightimaging.ai"
export API_TOKEN="eyJjdXN0b21lcl9pZCI6Imhvc3BpdGFsXzAwMSIs..."
export UPLOAD_ENDPOINT="/api/v1/upload"

# cURL Example
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/dicom" \
  -F "file=@image.dcm" \
  $API_BASE_URL$UPLOAD_ENDPOINT
```

### 2.3 Configure Auto-Forwarding (Optional)
1. Navigate to **Study Forwarding** or **Auto-Route**
2. Enable automatic forwarding to DeepSight Imaging AI
3. Configure forwarding rules:
   - Forward all studies
   - Forward specific sequences only
   - Forward based on study description
4. Set forwarding destination to API endpoint with your token

### 2.4 Test Configuration
1. Send a test image using your API token
2. Verify image appears in DeepSight Imaging AI dashboard
3. Check image quality and metadata in the "üì° Image Reception" tab

## Step 3: Network Configuration

### 3.1 Firewall Settings
Configure firewall to allow HTTPS traffic to DeepSight Imaging AI:

#### Windows Firewall:
```cmd
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="DeepSight Imaging AI HTTPS" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP remoteport=443
```

#### Linux iptables:
```bash
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
```

#### Network Equipment:
- Configure router/switch to allow HTTPS (port 443) outbound
- Ensure no network segmentation blocking HTTPS traffic
- Allow DNS resolution for `api.deepsightimaging.ai`

### 3.2 Network Security
- Use dedicated VLAN for medical imaging traffic
- Enable VPN for remote access
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
- Regular security audits

## Step 4: Verification and Testing

### 4.1 Connection Test
1. In DeepSight AI, go to "Image Reception" tab
2. Verify server shows "üü¢ DICOM Server Running"
3. Send test image from MRI scanner
4. Confirm image appears in "Recent Images" list

### 4.2 Image Quality Check
1. Open received image in DeepSight AI
2. Verify image displays correctly
3. Check metadata is complete
4. Test annotation and AI analysis features

### 4.3 Workflow Test
1. Complete end-to-end workflow:
   - Image received from MRI
   - Radiologist annotates image
   - AI analysis runs automatically
   - Report generated and reviewed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Connection Failed" Error
**Symptoms**: MRI cannot connect to DeepSight AI
**Solutions**:
- Verify DeepSight AI server is running
- Check IP address and port configuration
- Test network connectivity (ping, telnet)
- Verify firewall settings

#### 2. "Images Not Received" Error
**Symptoms**: MRI shows successful send, but images don't appear in DeepSight AI
**Solutions**:
- Check DICOM server logs
- Verify AE Title matches exactly
- Test with different image types
- Check for network timeouts

#### 3. "Image Display Issues" Error
**Symptoms**: Images received but display incorrectly
**Solutions**:
- Verify transfer syntax compatibility
- Check image compression settings
- Update DICOM server configuration
- Test with uncompressed images

#### 4. "Slow Image Transfer" Error
**Symptoms**: Images take long time to transfer
**Solutions**:
- Check network bandwidth
- Optimize transfer syntax settings
- Consider compression options
- Monitor network latency

### Diagnostic Commands:

#### Test Network Connectivity:
```bash
# Test if port is open
telnet [DeepSight AI IP] 104

# Test with netcat
nc -zv [DeepSight AI IP] 104
```

#### Monitor DICOM Traffic:
```bash
# Monitor network traffic
tcpdump -i any port 104

# Check DICOM server logs
tail -f /var/log/deepsight/dicom.log
```
